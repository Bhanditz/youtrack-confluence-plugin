youtrack-confluence-plugin
==========================

Allows inserting dynamic YouTrack issue links to Confluence pages via {issue} macro. 
Links change style depending on issue state and have detailed tooltips about issues they lead to. 

Uses YouTrack REST API library (https://github.com/rayshade/YouTrackRestApi). Current version of this plugin code is written using the latest version of that library, so if you prefer building everything from sources yourself, just clone the latest commit from that repo.
